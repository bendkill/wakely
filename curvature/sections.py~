Script for processing steps from a given Nx2 csv file. Relevant functions:
parse: returns an array with the csv data.
map_curvatures: returns the list of points at which curvature spikes
    note that these points must be separated by at least 1 degree. This needs fixing.
plot: plot the csv data on a semilog scale with the sections added as vertical lines.
